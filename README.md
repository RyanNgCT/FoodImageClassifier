# FoodImageClassifier
Did this for my Deep Learning Module Assignment 1. Based of the food-101 dataset on Kaggle.

Assigned 10 types of food.
* caprese_salad
* hamburger
* creme_brulee
* baklava
* omelette
* paella
* peking_duck
* cheesecake
* sushi
* beef_carpaccio

## Preprocessing Steps
1) Download food-101 zip from this [website](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101). Make sure you download the `.zip` file and **NOT** the `.zip.zip` file. ***Warning: If you have a non-NVMe SSD, this could take up to 8 hours to unzip***

2) Place Image_Preprocessing.ipynb, 40.txt and the extracted image file (food-101/food-101/food-101/images) into the same base directory of choice. An example is given below:

3) Run Image_Preprocessing.ipynb with 40.txt and your path of the images folder specified.
