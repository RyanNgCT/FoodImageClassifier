# FoodImageClassifier
Did this for my Deep Learning Module Assignment 1. Based of the food-101 dataset on Kaggle.

Assigned 10 types of food.
* caprese_salad
* hamburger
* creme_brulee
* baklava
* omelette
* paella
* peking_duck
* cheesecake
* sushi
* beef_carpaccio

## Preprocessing Steps
Optional. Download food-101 zip from this [website](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101). Make sure you download the `.zip` file and **NOT** the `.zip.zip` file. (*Only do this if you want to train more than my 10 types of foods specified*)
